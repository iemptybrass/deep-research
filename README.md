# Deep Research:

This repository contains detailed findings and analyses generated using chatgpt's Deep Research.

## Summary

**Prompt 1:**  
Give an in-depth analysis of advanced laptop power-saving methods across Intel, AMD, and ARM architectures, covering hyper-threading/SMT, CPU-to-RAM task offloading, undervolting, frequency scaling, idle tuning, and Linux kernel-level optimizations, including NixOS and Lix integration, with a focus on trade-offs between power savings and performance, and include both experimental and stable techniques.

**Prompt 2:**  
Provide a comprehensive comparison between Lix and Nix on NixOS, covering all technical, functional, and usability differences, including architecture, features, performance, compatibility, and recommended improvements for Lix.

**Prompt 3:**  
Compare a wide range of AI models specifically designed for coding tasks. Include both open-source and proprietary models, and cover those that can run locally as well as those available via cloud APIs. For each model, provide up-to-date details on pricing (most important), supported programming languages, intended use cases, model size, speed, accuracy on benchmarks, and licensing. Prioritize free options for local deployment and highlight performance differences relative to cost.
